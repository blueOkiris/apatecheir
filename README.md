## Description

A naturally controlled artificial bionic hand. Name comes from Greek - "απάτη" fake + "χείρ" hand. Pronounced like /ə.'pʰaː.ɾə.kʰeɚ/

I want to intercept brain waves so that a user who is missing their hand can subconsciouly control it just as those with hands intact would. It should be controlled in a completely natural feeling way without need of conscious thought.

Although functionality will be simple (open close, possibly separated fingers), I want a controller that can use thresholds to take my brain signals, interpret them into those simple movements, and have the artificial hand mimic my hand's movements.

## Brain Signal Interpretation

Here I'll explain how I interpret the brain's signals

## Hand Mechanical Design

Here I'll explain the physical hardware that moves the hand itself

## Control System

Here I'll explain my choice for controller and the software it houses
